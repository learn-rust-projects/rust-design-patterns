## Introduction

Design patterns are formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Utilizing design patterns can accelerate the development process by providing tested and proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns helps prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for developers and architects familiar with these patterns.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the material, you should be familiar with various software design principles.

All designs should be as simple as possible. Start with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It), and "Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work" principles. Complexity and patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical extensibility.

We hope you find the object-oriented solutions presented in this repository useful for your architectures, and that you enjoy learning about them as much as we enjoyed developing them.
