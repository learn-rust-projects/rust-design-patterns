// Introduction to the Simple Factory Pattern
// The Simple Factory Pattern refers to using a function (the factory) that
// decides which specific object to instantiate based on the parameters passed
// in, and then returns it. This pattern encapsulates the object creation logic
// in one place, so the caller does not need to know how the object is
// createdâ€”they just use it.

// Advantages: Decouples object creation from usage, centralizes logic, and is
// easy to maintain. Disadvantages: As the number of product types increases,
// the factory function can become quite large.
